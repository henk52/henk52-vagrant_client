You have to provide the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run yourself.
 The file is found in the GuestAddition ISO; VBoxGuestAdditions.iso

You can get the files by either:
 Mounting the Guest additions CD (Units -> Install guest additions (Host+D) )
   Then copying the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run in to this 'files' directory.

  Or copy the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso into your OS, then 
    fuseiso  VBoxGuestAdditions.iso ~/tmp
    cp ~/tmp/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run .
    fusemount -u ~/tmp

    The iso, on windows, is in: C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
